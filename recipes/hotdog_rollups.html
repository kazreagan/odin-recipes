        <li>8(1 ounce) slices white bread(such as Wonder Bread)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
        <li>4 thin slices sharp Cheddar cheese, halved</li>
        <li>8 beef hot dogs(such as Oscar Mayor Classic Wieners Hot Dogs)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons minced yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish</li>
        <li>1/4 cup barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspooon seasoned salt(such as Lawry's)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>Step 1</h5>
            <p>Gather all ingredients</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h5>Step 2</h5>
            <p>Using a rolling pin, roll each bread slice until entirely flat. Trim just the crust off each bread slice, forming a 4x4-inch square. Spread each bread slice with an even layer of mustard(about 3/4 teaspoon per slice).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h5>Step 3</h5>
            <p>Working with 1 slice of bread at a time, place a halved cheese slice on the edge of the bread closest to you; place 1 hot dog horizontally on top of the cheese slice. If needed, trim the ends of the hot dogs so that no hot dog extends over edges of bread. Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons onion horizontally across the cheese slice above the hot dog followed by 1 teaspoon of relish</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h5>Step 4</h5>
            <p>Roll up tightly, applying gentle pressure to help seal the bread seams together. Slice crosswise into 3 equal pieces (about 1 1/4-inches each), and transfer to a serving platter. Repeat process with remaining ingredients. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes, or according to manufacturer's instructions. Lightly coat tops and sides of roll-ups with cooking spray. Working in 2 batches, add roll-ups to basket, spacing them 1/2-inch apart, and cook until bread is lightly golden brown, about 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h5>Step 5</h5>
            <p>Stir together barbecue sauce, mayonnaise, and seasoned salt in a small bowl until evenly combined.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h5>Step 6</h5>
            <p>Serve hotdog roll-ups with mayonnaise mixture.</p>
